### App

Sets up a new ReactJS app, generating all the boilerplate you need to get started. The app generator also facilitates the following:

1. Configures a Gruntfile to run the app on a local server.
2. Configures Webpack to modularise the app enabling [loading of various file formats](http://webpack.github.io/docs/loader-list.html) e.g. JSON, CSS, PNG, etc.
3. Configures [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) to run all tests.
4. Watches for changes and recompiles JS and refreshes the browser.
